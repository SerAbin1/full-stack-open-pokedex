Some common steps in a CI setup include *linting*, *testing*, and *building*. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by Google.
In Python:
Linters:

- pylint
- ruff
  Testing:
- unittest
- pytest
  Building:
- PyBuilder

What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask Google!

- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- AWS CodePipeline

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

- AWS option for cloud-based
- GitLab CI also for cloud based
  Complexity I would think
